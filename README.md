# Planto Assessment: CSV Editor

Below are additional notes that may be useful.

## Features & Assumptions

- Application handles arbitrary number of columns (columns are editable)
- Does not handle large file sizes (e.g. no pagination)
- Adding and removing new rows, columns, and cells are not supported

## Test Cases

- Test for uploading requires a `test.csv` file under `test/resources/testfiles/`
- Incomplete coverage; only included some controller testing
